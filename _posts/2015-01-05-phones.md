Protecting your laptop or desktop is great, but what about threats to your privacy & security when you’re on your phone? Smartphones are uniquely desirable targets for malicious threats because they carry so much concentrated personal information about you. The GPS in your phone can track your physical location throughout the day. Much of your communications with friends, often with sensitive information or pictures, are stored in accessible texts. Often times your emails, pictures, videos, files, and all sorts of other important data are stored amongst your apps.


While smartphones are huge asset for functionality and convenience, the tradeoff is less control over your digital space. You have to trust your Apps to use your data safely. You have to trust your operating system to withstand hacking. You have to trust your provider to not interfere with your data or calls. So with so much personal information at risk, how do you use your smartphone without compromising your digital autonomy?

Encrypt! Encrypt! Encrypt! 
As you secure your digital space, it’s important to recognize that apps do not only have to be a threat to your security: they can also be an asset! Some of the most sensitive data on your phone, from your pictures to your texts to your internet browsing can all be secured. And the most common thread should be a familiar one: Encryption!

By encrypting your phone and the data found on it, you can have greater assurance that if something were to happen to phone (whether it be stolen or hacked), you’d still have protections in place. We’re going to walk through a few recommendations for ways you can encrypt your files, your texts, and even your phone calls.

PROTECT YR HARDWARE: Phone Encryption on iOS and Android
Just as you can encrypt your computer so no-one can dig around on your hard-drive without a password, you can encrypt your phone. This is especially important because if you were ever to have your phone stolen or confiscated; you definitely wouldn’t want someone to have free reign over all the pictures, videos, texts, and contacts on your phone. iOS and Android have different ways to accomplish hardware encryption, so feel free to read whichever is appropriate for you. We’ve linked to some nifty guides that can explain the process better than we can :)

PROTECT YR TEXTS
Texts can be some of the most personal and private communications we have. They’re also especially vulnerable to being seen by others: your cell network can see them as they’re being sent (as can any government agency who’s chummy with that network). Anyone with access to your phone could read them too (hopefully you encrypted your phone to avoid this!).

There are a multitude of apps whose sole purpose is to protect your texts. Some offer features such as encrypting your texts when not in use, deleting messages (for both parties) after a given amount of time, and sending encrypted messages to people who share the same app. If you’ve ever sent an especially private text that you wouldn’t want an unapproved stranger to see, you can imagine how useful these features could be.

When evaluating an app designed for security, it’s especially important to remember our Know Your Apps questions: Why is this app being offered, what permissions does it need, and would I be comfortable with a stranger seeing my data? However, because these are security apps, we have an extra question to consider: Are these apps proven to be secure? Many companies have outside agencies verify the security of their apps (because no-one would want them if they weren’t truly secure). They use only minimal permissions because excessive data collection could also ruin their claims of security. It can be very hard though for us normal folks to truly know which apps are living up to their claims. However, there are a few good signals to look for.

Apps developed by the open source community (a term for software whose code can be analyzed by outsiders, like you or me, if we liked) are a plus because they offer transparency. This might seem counterintuitive since we don’t often associate transparency with security, but in these cases it’s a benefit because it means outside security professionals can know EXACTLY what an app is doing and whether it’s effective. With a privately developed app, you can only trust the word of the developers, but with an open-source app, you can research and find out if the app has been analyzed as being effective and secure in its purpose.

So what apps should you use? Well, it depends on what kind of security you’re looking for. We’re big fans of end-to-end encryption, which means a text is encrypted before it’s sent to its recipient and can only ever be read on your phone and theirs. A collaborative open-source project called Open WhisperSystems has partnered with WhatsApp to offer this protection on WhatsApp on iOS, while offering their own client called TextSecure on Android.

There are lots of other options are there too, so if WhatsApp and TextSecure are not to your liking, check out this guide of different iOS and Android clients that offer novel ways of securing your texts:

PROTECT YR CALLS
Wiretapping is practically an American tradition. If there are ever times where you would not feel comfortable or safe having a phone call monitored, you should consider using a phone app whose specialty is encrypting your calls. Most apps accomplish this by sending your conversation over your data connection rather than your cellular network connection, thus allowing the 1s and 0s to be encrypted before reaching your conversation partner. We recommend reading the previous section about securing texts before you choose an app to use: the same critical approaches for evaluating a security app apply.

PROTECT YR SMARTPHONE BROWSING
Unfortunately, the nature of smartphone browsers is such that you don’t have as many security plug-in options like you do on a computer. On Android you can download the mobile Firefox browser and use all of our suggested plug-ins, but otherwise the browsers on iOS and Android do not offer this level of control :(

If you’re an android user, you can install an app called Orbot that can push your phone’s internet traffic through to Tor network, giving you fantastic anonymity. You can configure certain apps, like twitter, to use the Tor network, or can just force all your traffic through Tor! Unfortunately, this app is only found on Android:

Earlier in the guide, we talked about encrypting your web browsing with a VPN. Fortunately, you can use a VPN on your phone as well! If you already have a VPN provider, it’s relatively easy to set-up on your phone. Follow Apple’s instructions for iOS or check out OpenVPN (our recommended VPN client for Android). As always, be critical before you download anything!

Final Thoughts on Cell Phone Security
You’ve thoroughly vetted all your apps. You encrypt your phone, your texts, and even some of your phone calls. Your phone is a fortress! Or is it?

The most crucial thing to remember is that no phone is 100% secure. From hackers to government agencies, there are very determined people out there who know more about our vulnerabilities than we do. Your most trusted app developer could have their servers compromised. The FBI could use a specially designed program to hack your encrypted phone or track you at a protest (this happens!). Any number of things could go wrong, and rarely would you have the power to do anything about it. But that is NOT YOUR FAULT. Malicious attacks are the fault of the attackers. Invasive apps are the fault of manipulative developers. You have a right to electronic safety: If it is willfully compromised by someone else, it is an encroachment on your electronic autonomy. Digital victim-blaming is not okay!

And lastly, if you are ever in a situation where personal safety is absolutely necessary, such as attending an event with significant police presence or avoiding an abusive/predatory person, consider leaving your phone at home until you feel safe, or use a disposable phone. Turning your phone off for a bit, and then back on, actually triggers some government surveillance programs, so don’t try it if you’re going to a demonstration or something. These approaches aren’t always possible though; this guide cannot tell you what is right for you. But your digital space is yours to manage: whatever action you decide is the right one.
