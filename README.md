# A DIY Guide to Feminist Cybersecurity

https://hackblossom.org/cybersecurity/

This is a comprehensive, succinct, and accessible DIY cybersecurity guide geared towards feminists, activists, and their friends. If you would like to contribute, get in touch :)

### Installation
The guide is built using the static site generator, Jekyll. Unfortunately, our guide is a relic of simpler times, so we're stuck on an older version of Jekyll for the time-being! Specifically, version 2.5.3. The following steps will get you up and running with a local version of the guide on your machine. Note that these steps are for OS X El Capitan; Windows and Linux users, adjust accordingly!

```
// Make sure you installed jekyll's requirements: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
$ git clone https://github.com/noahke/DIY-Feminist-Cybersecurity.git
$ gem install jekyll -v '2.5.3' -n /usr/local/bin
$ jekyll serve -w
// The guide is ~alive~ at http://0.0.0.0:4000/
```
